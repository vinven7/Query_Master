# Query_Master
The Query_Master takes a list of keywords and queries the 1) ScienceDirect 2) CrossRef database for DOIs on the keyword
With ScienceDirect, it takes the number of DOIs as a parameter
However, the CrossRef search is exhaustive and runs until the list is complete. This can take a long time
